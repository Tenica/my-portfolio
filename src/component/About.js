                <p>As a self taught programmer,I started learning programming after my NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) in the year 2017 and 
                it has been a wonderful experience so far.</p>

                <p>Yes i know it can be frustrating especially those errors!But i had a good mentor Mr.Sab Udeh Chukwumdimma C.E.O Kierian Technology 
                who guided, encouraged and assisted me with materials which was instrumental to my learning and still of 
                great value to me. I also inbided in myself a spirit of self-discipline amd had a strong passion and desire to learn.
                For HTML5 and CSS3 i learnt from Channel 9 tutorials by Bob Tabor (Senior Porgram Manager-Microsoft) and W3schools.
                I also downloaded alot of free courses on Youtube.</p>
                <p>For Javascript,Nodejs,Express,Reactjs tutorials of Andrew Mead from Udemy which i bought helped me alot
                in unserstanding the concept of Javacript and its various frameworks.I also downloaded courses on facebook which were very
                helpful.Also websites like stackoverflow, Medium, Dev etc also helped me and still assist me till this day. Also my 
                working expreiences inchuding internship which you can find on My CV also made me a better experience as the saying goes <q>Experience is the best teacher"</q></p>
